# Outlier-Analysis Using Gaussian Mixture Model.
This repository contains an analysis of outlier detection using the [Gaussian Mixture Model](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/mixture.html) (GMM). Outlier detection is a critical aspect of data analysis, crucial for identifying anomalies, ensuring data quality, and improving the robustness of machine learning models. GMM, a probabilistic model that assumes all data points are generated from a mixture of a finite number of Gaussian distributions with unknown parameters, provides a powerful method for this purpose.


## Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

You have installed the latest version of [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/install/index.html)
## Installation
To install this project, follow these steps:
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n custom_env_name
```
This command will create a new Conda environment that includes the dependencies needed for the project.
## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
```bash
conda activate <env_name>
jupyter notebook
```
Replace <env_name> with the name of the Conda environment specified above. This will activate the environment and start Jupyter Notebook, where you can open and run the notebook file.
